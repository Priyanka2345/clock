Introduction 
We have learned about custom hooks and how they can help us creating 
data driven features and at the same time reusable code. This first 
task is to practise creating another custom hook and a component using it. 

The steps to do to finish the tasks
1. Create a new branch "task-1" in the Clock repository.
2. Add a component which is showing the seconds only of our time.
3. Create a hook for it to support it with data.
